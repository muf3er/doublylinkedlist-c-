# doublylinkedlist-cpp-

A C++ program that implements doubly linked lists for a clothe retailer store as their point of sales system and developed using Visual Studio.

The requirement was to develop and demonstrate a prototype that illustrates the basic functionalities of the system and the functionalities are 

1. Place an order 
  
  1.1   View a list of clothes for sale (clothes must be sorted by cost ie. cheapest first) 
  1.2   Search for a type of clothing 
  1.3   Move back and forth between the clothes that are for sale 
  1.4   Select clothes to order 
  1.5   Checkout order 

2. View orders 
  
  2.1  View all orders  
  2.2  Move back and forth between orders (prioritise orders that require delivery) 
  2.3  Modify an order 
  2.4  Delete an order   
  
 The system can be run by downloading the .zip file and running it on Visual Studio.
